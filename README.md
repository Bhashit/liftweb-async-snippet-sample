## An example liftweb app for async snippets

This is sample code for a blog-post I wrote.

This is just a demo app that was developed using
[Lift 2.6 Final](http://liftweb.net/26) release, with one of the stock
templates named 'lift\\_advanced\\_bs3' that comes with the
[downloads](http://liftweb.net/download).

The app is a demo for rendering snippets in liftweb where you need to
deal with Futures, but don't want to use blocking code.

The code contains enough comments, and should be self-explanatory.
